  <!--<Ammo_Gauss_charge.description>Gauss rounds have perfect performance in nearly every category - and above perfect notably in piercing and armor penetration, giving it the ability to completely ignore any kind of armor in the series. In fact, Gauss rounds perform better against heavier armor, and along with some sniper rounds is one of the only munitions in the game capable of killing multiple targets with one shot. Also they are able to kill the most dangerous mutants in few shots. They consist of encapsulated pieces of the Flash artifact, which supply the energy required to propel the electromagnetic slugs at extreme velocities.</Ammo_Gauss_charge.description>-->
