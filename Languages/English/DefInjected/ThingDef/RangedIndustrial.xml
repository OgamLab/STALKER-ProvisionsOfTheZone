  <!--<Gun_TOZBM16M.label>TOZ BM-16</Gun_TOZBM16M.label>-->
  <!--<Gun_TOZBM16M.description>TOZ BM-16 is an excellent weapon for hunting small animals: wild boars, cats, blind dogs. Quite accurate and at the same time with good indicators of killing power and stopping power. That's all, the obvious advantages end there. The double-barreled shotgun takes quite a long time to reload, and two charges are clearly not enough. So it is not worth going with this weapon to people or some chimeras..</Gun_TOZBM16M.description>-->

  <!--<Gun_Buket.label>Buket S-2</Gun_Buket.label>-->
  <!--<Gun_Buket.description>The Buket S-2 is a versatile weapon for close and even medium range firefights. With it's low fire rate and recoil it is easy to manage while firing it in full-auto. The Buket S-2 uses 9x18mm which is one of the most common and cheapest ammo types found in The Zone. Combined with the armor-piercing variant of the 9x18mm the Buket S-2 can take out armored opponents with ease. The Buket's biggest weakness it's low magazine capacity of 20 rounds + 1 in the chamber. Obtaining the high capacity attachment is a must for the Buket which boosts it's magazine capacity to 30 rounds. It is also relatively cheap (compared to other primary weapons) to repair and upgrade the Buket. The Buket S-2 can be a good companion-piece for a Stalker looking for close range engagements or someone who is looking for a solid backup weapon.</Gun_Buket.description>-->

  <!--<Gun_Colt.description>Originally used as an African buffalo hunting pistol, the Rhino is a supremely powerful revolver that will blow enemies away from close-to-mid range and is especially effective against radioactive mutants.The power of the Rhino is such that it even rivals some shotguns, but it doesn't compromise on accuracy or range, making it the best overall sidearm in terms of raw power.
